# conventional-pr-title-action

This is a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that ensures that your PR title matches the [Conventional Commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

This is helpful when you're using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) with the Conventional Commits preset. When using the `Squash and merge` strategy, Github will suggest to use the PR title as the commit message. With this action you can validate that the PR title will lead to a correct commit message.

See [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for sample titles.

## Inputs

### `success-state`

**Required** Description of the status check if validation succeeds. Default `"Title follows the specification."`.

### `failure-state`

**Required** Description of the status check if validation fails. Default `"Title does not follow the specification."`.

### `context-name`

**Required** Persistent status check context key. Default `"conventional-pr-title"`.

### `preset`

**Required** Conventional changelog preset. Default `"conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits@5.0.0"`.

### `target-url`

**Optional** URL to be used when linking the "Details" in the actions overview. Default `"https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary"`.

## Outputs

### `success`

`true` if the validation succeed. `false` otherwise.

### `error`

In case of an error (`success=false`), contains the error message for additional processing or usage in notifications.
